The Department of Electronics Engineering was established in 1988. It has made significant progress since its inception and attained the status of a pioneering Department particularly in the Faculty of Engineering and Technology and in general in the University. It is the only department in the faculty of Engineering &amp; Technology to have a coveted   DSA-I  (Department  of special assistance) status from the UGC. This DSA status has been obtained in a record time of only ten years (after DRS-I and DRS-II) instead of fifteen years (after DRS-III) primarily on the basis of the quality of research publications in IEEE Transactions and other high impact journals. The department is looking forward to achieve the status of "Centre of Excellence" in the near future. It has well qualified faculty with many PhDs from abroad and premier institutes of our country with a combined h-index of 29.

Recently,  an MoU between AMU and SCL Chandigarh (an ISRO establishment) has been signed on the 11th of January, 2017 which will  enable the fabrication of ICs designed by the department.
</p>




<p align="justify">

<p align="justify">
 
The Department offers an undergraduate (B. Tech.) course in Electronics Engineering and two postgraduate (M.Tech.) courses in (1) Electronic Circuits &amp; Systems Design and (2) Communication &amp; Information System. The subjects offered at both, UG &amp; PG levels cover almost all upcoming and areas of significance viz. Analog &amp; Digital Electronics, Microelectronics, VLSI Design &amp; Technology, Electronic Instrumentation, Control Systems, Analog &amp; Digital Communications, Microwave Engineering, Radio, Television, Radars, Optical Communication, Satellite Communication, Mobile Communication, Computer Communication Networks, Image and Signal processing, etc. The well-equipped laboratories supplement a large number of these courses.
